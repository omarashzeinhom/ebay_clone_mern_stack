To obtain API keys for the values `ATLAS_URI`, `PORT`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, you will need to follow specific steps for each service. Below is a tutorial on how to obtain these keys:

### 1. MongoDB Atlas (ATLAS_URI):
   - Go to the [MongoDB Atlas website](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
   - Create a new cluster or select an existing one.
   - Once your cluster is created/selected, navigate to the "Connect" tab.
   - Follow the instructions to whitelist your IP address and create a MongoDB user with appropriate permissions.
   - After setting up the user, you will get a connection string. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB Atlas username and password respectively in the provided `ATLAS_URI` format.

### 2. PORT:
   - The `PORT` variable defines the port on which your server will listen for incoming HTTP requests.
   - You can set it to any available port number. The default port for HTTP is 80, but commonly used alternatives are 3000, 5000, or 8000.
   - Choose a port number that is not in use by other applications on your system.

### 3. JSON Web Token (JWT) Setup (JWT_SECRET, JWT_EXPIRES_IN):
   - `JWT_SECRET`: This is a secret key used to sign JWT tokens for authentication.
   - `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: This defines the expiration time for JWT tokens.
   - Generate a random string to use as your `JWT_SECRET`.
   - Set `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` to the desired expiration time for JWT tokens (e.g., `90d` for 90 days, `1h` for 1 hour).

### 4. Cloudinary Setup (CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET):
   - Go to the [Cloudinary website](https://cloudinary.com/) and sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
   - After logging in, go to the dashboard.
   - You will find your `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` on the dashboard.
   - Navigate to the "Account Details" section to obtain your `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`.

### Example `.env` File:
```plaintext
ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.vr0db7g.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

### Note:
- Ensure to keep your `.env` file secure and never expose it to the public, especially in version control systems like Git.
- Replace placeholders like `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual credentials.
- Always follow best practices for handling sensitive information like API keys and secrets.

By following these steps, you should be able to obtain the necessary API keys for your application's configuration.
